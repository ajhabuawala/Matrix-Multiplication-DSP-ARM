# Matrix Multiplication on Heterogeneous Processors

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to optimize and speedup the matrix multiplication on Heterogeneous Processors.Instead of using ARM to compute the product of two matrices, an on board DSP which can perform the computation much
faster in combination with the ARM, is used. By resolving an appropriate communication
scheme and achieving parallel computation, a speed up can be achieved. 

This is an group assignment for the course 'Embedded System Lab' taught at TU Delft. See PDF for more details.
